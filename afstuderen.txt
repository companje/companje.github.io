**Globe4D as a Tool for Scientific Data Visualization and Exploration**

Scientific data visualization gives scientists more insight in large complex datasets. Datasets can be visualized and explored on various media. Interaction within data visualization is important to be able to constantly look at the data from different perspectives. Scientific data visualization can lead to the discovery of new patterns in datasets, new questions can arise, conclusions can be drawn and new hypotheses can be generated. 
\\
The research described in this paper investigates to what extend Globe4D – an interactive physical globe resulting from earlier research and formerly only used for educational purposes – can be used as a tool for scientists for visualizing and exploring datasets during the process of data analysis. 
\\
Globe4D has – because of it's shape and interaction model – certain interface characteristics different than the scientific tools used on a computer. We investigated the views of scientists from different fields on data visualization, the scientific tools they use and in particular their views and ideas about using Globe4D in their research. Based on their suggestions we implemented certain improvements in Globe4D's hardware and software where after a case study has been done on one particular research project focusing on visually representing ontologies using different geometrical representations. During this case study the development of a toolkit has been started for scientists to be able to use Globe4D as input- and output device in their own scientific software tools.
