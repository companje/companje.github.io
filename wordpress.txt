===== Facebook Page Photo Gallery plugin not showing thumbnails ====
From https://wordpress.org/support/topic/thumbnails-didnt-load-any-more: Since WordPress 4.0 the thumbnails didn't load any more. So began searching for the loading of thumbnails in your code and tried commented out line 7 and 8 of single-album.php and line 3 and 4 of single-album-ajax.php and added
  $picture = $photo->picture;
