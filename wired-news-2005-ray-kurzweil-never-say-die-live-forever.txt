Niet zo gerelateerd aan m'n afstudeeronderzoek. Wel cool. Ik mag die [[Ray Kurzweil]] wel.

===== Summary =====
*As part of his daily routine, Kurzweil ingests 250 supplements, eight to 10 glasses of alkaline water and 10 cups of green tea. He also periodically tracks 40 to 50 fitness indicators, down to his "tactile sensitivity." Adjustments are made as needed.
*Ray Kurzweil: 'immortality .... is no more than 20 years away.'
*Boek: Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever.
*nanobots
*The claims are fantastic, but Kurzweil is no crank.
*modern [[Edison]].
*Critics say Kurzweil's predictions of immortality are wild fantasies based on unjustifiable leaps from current technology.
*Sherwin Nuland, a bioethics professor at Yale University's School of Medicine, calls Kurzweil a "genius" but also says he's a product of a narcissistic age when brilliant people are becoming obsessed with their longevity.
*"They've forgotten they're acting on the basic biological fear of death
*critics often fail to appreciate the exponential nature of technological advance,
*His predictions, Kurzweil said, are based on carefully constructed scientific models that have proven accurate. For instance, in his 1990 book, [[The Age of Intelligent Machines]], Kurzweil predicted the development of a worldwide computer network and of a computer that could beat a chess champion.
*three bridges to immortality.

*"Death is a tragedy," a process of suffering that rids the world of its most tested, experienced members -- people whose contributions to science and the arts could only multiply with agelessness, he said. Kurzweil said he's no cheerleader for unlimited scientific progress and added he knows science can't answer questions about why eternal lives are worth living. That's left for philosophers and theologians, he said. But to him there's no question of huge advances in things that make life worth  living, such as art, culture, music and science. "Biological evolution passed the baton of progress to human cultural and  technological development," he said. Lee Silver, a Princeton biologist, said he'd love to believe in the future as Kurzweil sees it, but the problem is, humans are involved. The instinct to preserve individuality, and to gain advantage for yourself and your children, would survive any breakthrough into biological immortality.
