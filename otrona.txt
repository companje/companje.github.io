==Keyboard Interface==
The I/O RTC section of the processor board contains the connector to the Attache keyboard (J502). Lines B6 and B7 of the PIO offer simple serial interface to the keyboard. Refer to "Keyboard" page 2-67 for additional logic information concerning the keyboard.
The keyboard logic monitors all the keys. When the logic detects a pressed key, it pulls data line 4 of connector J502 to a low level. U511 is a voltage comparator which senses the low signal from line 4, and sends a high signal to B6 of the PIO. The internal PIO logic recognizes the B6 signal as an indication of a pressed key. .
The processor monitors PIO line B6 to check for a character waiting. If a character is waiting, the processor sends clock pulses to PIO line B7, and serially reads the 7 keycode data bits (plus shift and control bits) on B6. The processor then translates these bits into an ASCII keycode, corresponding to the key pressed.
The voltage comparator (U511) is also used to detect system reset from the keyboard. The comparator checks for specific voltage levels from the keyboard. If the voltage level is below one and a half volts, this indicates a reset. The comparator then generates the signal RB Reset. The comparator also checks the POR (Power Okay) line and generates a PB Reset signal accordingly.
The POK line is delayed through a resistor - capacitor network to         the EPROM Enable, CMOS RAM, and RTC from being written to erroneously while the power level is changing.
Power for the keyboard is supplied by a +12 volt line on pin 2 of the keyboard connector. The line uses resistors to protect the keyboard.
