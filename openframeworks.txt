====== OpenFrameworks ======
Since I met [[Theodore Watson]] at [[Cinekid 2007]] I'm aware of the power of openFrameworks. Since then I'm using it as base for the [[Globe4D]] software.

Those who like the philosophy of the [[Processing]] framework but prefer [[C++]] because of its speed really should check out openFrameworks.

There is a forum at [[http://openframeworks.cc/forum]]
