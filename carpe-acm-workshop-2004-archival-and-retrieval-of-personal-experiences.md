===== Summary =====
*Continuous Archival and Retrieval of Personal Experiences
*1945, when [[Vannevar Bush]] published [[As We May Think]], positing the [[Memex device]] in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. His vision was astonishingly broad for the time, including full-text search, annotations, hyperlinks, virtually unlimited storage and even stereo cameras mounted on eyeglasses.
*we can now consider continuous archival and retrieval of all media relating to personal experiences. The continuous archival paradigm fundamentally alters our relationship to biological memory, since analysis of such media powerfully augments human memory. 
*pioneering cyborg [[Steve Mann]] and industry legend [[Gordon Bell]].
*Attendees will hear about capture ranging from sensing brain waves, body posture and heart rates to recording conversations and computer mouse clicks. We will consider how human memory works, how to represent personal knowledge on computers, and how new forms of artistic expression may emerge.
