A study course at [[http://mediatechnology.leiden.edu]]

''To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advances in science." — Albert Einstein''

The Media Technology program recognizes creativity as an important factor in scientific innovation. In this course, principles and organization of scientific research are presented, and through examples the concept of “creative research” is introduced. With that we mean actual scientific research that was brought about in unconventional or creative ways, in order to come to results that could otherwise not be envisioned or achieved. Topics of the course are principles of science, organization of the scientific world, scientific publication, creative and unconventional research, asking the right questions, and finding the right data. Student participation is high, with multiple homework assignments and a final research project.

Seven lectures are combined with intensive homework, student presentations and projects. Compulsory attendance. Participants must do a final research project and write a paper about this.
