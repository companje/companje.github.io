====== openFrameworks workshop in Auckland======
{{  :blog:of.jpg?100|}}This week an [[http://openframeworks.cc|OpenFrameworks]] workshop / meeting will take place in Auckland, New Zealand. The exact date/time and location will be announced later this week.

<blockquote>openFrameworks is a free application framework designed for creative coding. Itâ€™s a c++ library designed to assist the creative process by providing a simple and intuitive framework for experimentation.

OpenFrameworks is designed to work as a general purpose glue, and wraps together several commonly used libraries under a tidy interface: openGL for graphics, rtAudio for audio input and output, freeType for fonts, freeImage for image input and output, quicktime for video playing and sequence grabbing.

The code is written to be both cross platform (PC, Mac, Linux, iPhone) and cross compiler. The API is designed to be minimal and easy to grasp. There are very few classes, and inside of those classes, there are very few functions.</blockquote>

Topics that might being addressed during the session:
 * What is openFrameworks? Who made it and what can you do with it?
 * Some interactive art projects made with openFrameworks will be discussed.
 *How to create your own openFrameworks projects?
 *How to use OpenFrameworks for text, audio, vector graphics, 3D graphics, vector math, images, movies, live video, xml files, hardware (ie. Arduino), network (ie. Open Sound Control), hi-res PDF or Illustrator output etc.
 *How to build a simple Particle System and also how to create some nice graphic design effects for creating printable posters.
 *How to use Microsoft's Kinect in openFrameworks

If possible, bring a laptop with Mac OSX, Windows or Linux and download XCode (mac) or CodeBlocks (windows, linux) and download the OpenFrameworks version 0.062. Download and get instructions at: [[http://www.openframeworks.cc]].
