An [[http://openframeworks.cc|openFrameworks]] workshop will take place at [[http://www.colab.org.nz|CoLab]] at the Auckland University of Technology (AUT), New Zealand this Thursday (January, 27th @16:00h). 

<blockquote>openFrameworks is a free application framework designed for **creative coding**. Itâ€™s a c++ library designed to assist the creative process by providing a simple and intuitive framework for experimentation.
\\
OpenFrameworks is designed to work as a general purpose glue, and wraps together several commonly used libraries under a tidy interface: openGL for graphics, rtAudio for audio input and output, freeType for fonts, freeImage for image input and output, quicktime for video playing and sequence grabbing.
\\
The code is written to be both cross platform (PC, Mac, Linux, iPhone) and cross compiler. The API is designed to be minimal and easy to grasp. There are very few classes, and inside of those classes, there are very few functions.</blockquote>

Topics that will be addressed during the workshop:
 * What is openFrameworks? Who made it and what can you do with it?
 * Some interactive art projects made with openFrameworks will be discussed.
 *How to create your own openFrameworks projects?
 *How to use OpenFrameworks for text, audio, vector graphics, 3D graphics, vector math, images, movies, live video, xml files, hardware (ie. Arduino, multiple mice, Kinect), network (ie. Open Sound Control), PDF or Illustrator output etc.
 *How to build a simple Particle System and also how to create some nice graphic design effects for creating printable posters.
 *How to use Microsoft's Kinect in openFrameworks?
 *How to contribute to the community by creating addons?
 *How to make an iPhone App with openFrameworks?

OpenFrameworks is often considered as being 'the big brother of [[http://processing.org]] Processing' and is used a lot by interactive media artists.

If possible please bring a laptop:
* Mac: **Be sure** to have XCode / Developer Tools installed (it's on the 'application DVD' you got when you bought your mac).
* Windows or Linux: if you can please download and install CodeBlocks.

Location: Auckland University of Technology - AUT Tower
Date/time: Thursday 27th, January, 2011 from 16:00 until 21:00.
