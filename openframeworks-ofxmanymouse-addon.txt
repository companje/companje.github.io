====== OpenFrameworks ofxManyMouse addon ======
{{  blog:2008.05.01-23.28-01.png?240|}}I finished a first version of my ofxManyMouse addon for OpenFrameworks. It's based on the ManyMouse library by Ryan C. Gordon.

With this openFrameworks addon you can easily read values from multiple mouse devices. 

You can find it here:
[[http://companje.nl/downloads/openFrameworks/ofxManyMouse/addon_ofxManyMouse.zip|download addon (200KB)]]  
[[http://companje.nl/downloads/openFrameworks/ofxManyMouse/ofxManyMouseExample.zip|download example app (6.5MB)]] (in Code::Blocks on Win32)

One things I really want to add in the future is event handling, being able to for example register for an onMouseDown event.

I hope it will be of use for you. Good luck!
