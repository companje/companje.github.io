Laval Virtual 2007, one of the biggest European Virtual Reality conventions. Laval Virtual ReVolution is an annual honor to the world’s finest VR projects. This is a hall of fame award that decides the best Virtual Reality demonstration and/or application from all over the world.

At Laval Virtual 2007 we released a new version of [[Globe4D]]. This event in the west of France attracted over 10.000 people with all kinds of backgrounds: scientists, engineers, museum directors, school teachers, children from all ages, parents and grandparents. Exhibiting at Laval Virtual gave us the opportunity to test our four dimensional globe on a really big user group. Thousands of people enjoyed playing with Globe4D and learned about the history of the earth.</blockquote>
