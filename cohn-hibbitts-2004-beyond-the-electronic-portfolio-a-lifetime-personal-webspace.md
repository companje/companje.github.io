===== Summary =====
*develop a model providing a personal Web space for everyone, for their lifetimes and beyond?
*(e-portfolio) is higher educations new "got to have it" tool
*process of constructing an e-portfolio stimulates our students to engage in reflective thinking. E-portfolios will provide accreditation agencies with tangible evidence that students achieved standards-based outcomes. New graduates will use e-portfolios to showcase their creativity and accomplishments, notably to gain an edge in the job market.
*Where is the body of rigorous, research-based evidence that supports the e-portfolio as a pedagogical and presentational tool?
*Is there a downside to e-portfolio use?
*time-consuming process
*prefabricated, one-size-fits-most e-portfolio model 
*What do we wish for? That every citizen, at birth, will be granted a cradle-to-grave, lifetime personal Web space that will enable connections among personal, educational, social, and business systems.

==LPWS==
LPWS Attributes: What do we envision in referring to the lifetime personal Web space (LPWS)? Imagine a
magnificently equipped (with software, communication, search, and multimedia tools),
beehive-configured Web space that possesses sufficient organizational plasticity to
accommodate the users developmental capacities and needs across a lifetime. The LPWS
will thus be organized more like our brains than our file cabinets.
The virtual structure could consist of multiple cells with flexible entrance points. It would
allow connections between internal cells, as well as seamless connections to external
entities

LPWS will store searchable content (personal, educational, social, business) that was important in
a users past and make it accessible for future use, as well as current projects. Since
technology changes over time, the older sections of the Web space (for example, K12
grade content) might be technologically less sophisticated, but would connect nonetheless
to newer additions

The primary user would decide whether a cell is private or public (potentially functioning as an e-portfolio or Web site) and who will be permitted to enter various parts of the structure.
 
The LPWS will be engineered to be available anywhere, any time. It will be universally accessible to persons in most circumstances, including those with disabilities and children and adults without homes.

LPWS Precursors: Our concept of the LPWS incorporates both existing and envisioned technologies, a nearly
60-year-old vision of the future, and time-tested educational practices that reach back to
medieval times. The LPWS shares attributes in common with a microfilm-based device
proposed by [[Vannevar Bush]] in his now classic and prescient article "As We
May Think."

 Vannevar Bush 1945: "Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private
 file and library. It needs a name, and, to coin one at random, "memex" will do. A
 memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and
 communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with
 exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his
 memory."
 
Looking much farther back in time, we can see that the LPWS also possesses characteristics
of vade mecum (things you carry with you), such as "commonplace books," the personal
journals that contained authors writings, references, and resources. Commonplace books
originated in ancient Greece and were carried about by writers well into the nineteenth
century. These compendiums functioned as both personal references and were the
precursors of modern-day portfolios.

The LPWS we envision will also possess characteristics of the paidogogos (a person who
walks with you, as in the case of Greek slaves who accompanied Roman boys to school).
The LPWS could be programmed to remind, support, stimulate intellectual development,
and even cajole the user-student to action.

'''LPWS Benefits'''
*Educational Continuity: Less Knowledge Left Behind .... 
*College students typically sell their books and lose access to their collegiate course management Web sites.
*The LPWS construct will enable users to preserve more knowledge over time and to forge richer connections between their academic and work endeavors.
*Imagine the follwing LPWS-based scenario. A third-year medical student working on a problem-based learning (PBL) scenario confronts an unknown but vaguely familiar medical term. She searches her LPWS and revisits the Latin vocabulary she learned as a sophomore in high school.
*The LPWS also links seamlessly to the medical schools library archives and to the students notes of patients she previously observed in clinic.
*The student posts her PBL research in a portion of the LPWS that connects to the course Web site, where she receives feedback from her peers and the faculty preceptor. At the end of the PBL exercise, she commits the content she generated to her electronic portfolio.

*Community-Building: LPWS could link students to their research mentors electronic laboratory network or to a global learning space. The JURIST Web site (http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/) isan innovative example of the latter. JURIST presents continually-updated legal news edited at the University of Pittsburghs School of Law
*The strength of the JURIST model lies in its plasticity. It simultaneously preserves valuable content and integrates new scholarly activity, pedagogical methods, and technologies.

'''Future Challenges'''
*usability, and economic costs and benefits of the LPWS. ...... 
*It also must be accessible to all citizens, regardless of age, disability, or socioeconomic status..... 
*Significant public policy developments must be addressed to determine where to house these personal Web spaces and how best to protect individual privacy, security, and rights.
*what about changes in technology?
*technologies so that prior content is not lost during technological conversions?
*financial issues.

==LPWS Personas==
We have thus far proposed an individualized Web space that can simultaneously function
as a vade mecum, a paidogogos, a "guide on the side," a life-long storage space that retains
work products and their seminal versions, and a virtual exhibit of ones evolving work. The
work of an LPWS need not be limited to a persons active engagement in the space,
however, not even to the here and now. Even after an individual ceases to work or live, the
LPWS can survive as an historical record of that persons body of workas a virtual,
interactive archive, for example, such as a Web-based version of a U.S. presidential library.
We can draw on new and still developing technologies to illustrate how the LPWS might
employ chat bots and Persona-Bots to project the originators personality. These software
programs project the personality of an individual through words and physical appearance.
The now-famous John Lennon Persona-Bot2 attempts to recreate the personality of John
Lennon using a database of conversations he had during his lifetime.

*Digital Personnel technology synthesizes animated facial expressions with recorded speech. This, combined with chat-bot technology, can be applied to "humanize" an LPWS
*the process is difficult and complex. It is much more comfortable to focus on lesser efforts, such as the e-portfolio.
