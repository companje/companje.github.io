===== bootscripts Doodle3D =====
Print3D already has scripts, that where created for the WiFi-Box. It seems to use inotifyd, I'm not sure if that is something we can reuse. 
- [print3d_init](https://github.com/Doodle3D/print3d/blob/master/src/script/print3d_init). A init script that starts the print3d-manager as a deamon. 
- [print3d-manager](https://github.com/Doodle3D/print3d/blob/master/src/script/print3d-manager.sh). Uses inotifyd to start `print3d-new-device` when a new device is connected. 
- [print3d-new-device](https://github.com/Doodle3D/print3d/blob/master/src/script/print3d-new-device.sh). Figures out whether to start print3d in a seemingly crude way. If appropriate it tries to start `print3d-runner`
- [print3d-runner.sh](https://github.com/Doodle3D/print3d/blob/master/src/script/print3d-runner.sh). Starts the print3d deamon.
